#United World College of Southeast Asia - Open Campus Dataset

###by: [Clayton Miller](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Clayton_Miller2) - Nov, 28 2014
###Part of a series of Commercial Open Building Datasets on [datadrivenbuilding.org](http://datadrivenbuilding.org/)

This IPython notebook will open and explore data collected from the United World College of Southeast Asia Tampines Campus. The goal of this notebook is to explore and visualize some of the data with the annotation capable in a notebook. This notebook will open and explore an open temporal dataset from the building management and energy management system of <a href="https://www.uwcsea.edu.sg/east-campus" target="_blank">United World College of South East Asia Tampines Campus in Singapore</a>. 

<b>A detailed account of this sample dataset can be found in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263547828_A_seed_dataset_for_a_public_temporal_data_repository_for_energy_informatics_research_on_commercial_building_performance" target="_blank">a poster publication</a> at the 3rd Conf. on Future Energy Business & Energy Informatics in Rotterdam, Netherlands in June 2014.</b>

The goal of this notebook is to introduce a dataset of 2 years worth of time series measurements from an international school campus in Singapore. This data is part of a research project focused on utilizing data analytics to reduce the energy impact of buildings. Data analysis is meant to distill the various raw data sources sometimes found in building controls and energy management systems.

The building that will be focused on in this study is the United World College Campus in Singapore. It is a 70,000 sq.meter International School in which construction was completed in June 2011 and students first utilized the facility in September of that year. It is a certified Greemark Platinum building which means it is at the top of building ratings in terms of energy efficiency and sustainability.

The facility is extraordinary from a data analysis standpoint as it has a few extra sensors meansuring key energy information and that it is trending and storing much of the data generated by the building controls system. This is much different than a conventional commercial building which hardly ever stores any of the data from its controls systems. The main reason behind this is that operations staff find that too much raw data is unuseful and confusing.

UWC is different in that they would like to store and manage as much data as possible and look to researchers to help then get value from this repository. <b>We will focus on UWC's cooling system as it is approximately 65% of all the energy consumed on campus as year-round cooling and dehumidification are required in Singapore's climate. UWC spends approximately SGD $75,000 (40,000 Euros)/month on cooling energy consumption!</b>

====================

Background  
----------

If you are unfamiliar with IPython Notebook you can start with http://ipython.org/notebook


Installation  
------------

* Prerequisites  
One of the following distributions is needed. Please note that even if you have Python installed it is important to have one of these distributions installed and the binary for this installation in your path. This is because these distributions come packaged with all the supplementary libraries needed and these have been historically difficult to install separately.

  * EPD Free Enthought Python Distribution from http://enthought.com
  * Anaconda Python from http://continuum.io
  * Development has been done on v 1.5 of Anaconda distribution but EPD Free should work just as well.

* The following steps assume you have installed one of the distributions mentioned in prerequisites.

* From a zip or tar file
    * download the zip or tar file 
    * unpack the file to a directory called learnds
    * cd to the 'notebooks' subdirectory
    * start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
 
* From the git repo
    * clone the repo
    * cd to 'notebooks'
    * start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'
